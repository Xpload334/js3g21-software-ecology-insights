# GitHub Software Ecology Dashboard
## What is this?
This is a prototype for a web app that displays a dashboard for any public GitHub repository. It is an alternative to the native GitHub stats pages with a much neater user interface and easy to digest information.
Anyone interested in their project's performance or wanting to see the history of popular open-source project will definitely want to try this out.

## Why Make This?
This is a result of my Bsc Computer Science 3rd Year project and the subject of a report on the same topic. The report is yet to be written, but will document the process of designing, researching and developing this app.
I started researching and designing this back in October 2023 and began development in early January 2024. There were many different iterations on how to handle the API connections but ultimately I settled on this approaching using VueJS SFCs and Vite for building.
